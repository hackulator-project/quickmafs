# Quickmafs  
version 2.0  
Quickmafs is a math library that can parse infix notation such as `3+4-(2+3)^2` to get an answer.  
Version 2.0 is a complete rewrite, since I couldn't get version 1 working properly.  
This version first converts the infix to reverse polish notation using shunting yard, then uses a reverse polish notation calculator to solve the expression.  
Yes, the name is a reference to "Man's Not Hot."
